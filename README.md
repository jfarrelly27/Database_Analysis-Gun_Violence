# Database_Analysis-Gun_Violence
This project analyzes a database of mass shootings to identify patterns and trends. Using Oracle, Apex, and SQL, the team created an interactive web application that presents comprehensive data on weapon types, shooter characteristics, and event locations. The insights aim to inform policy-making and contribute to efforts to curb gun violence.
